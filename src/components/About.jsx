            Rate My Film was built in April 2021 by web developer and filmmaking
            teacher Daniel Cranney as a way to help student, amateur, no-budget
            or low-budget filmmakers learn more about how films are age rated in
            the UK, in a user-friendly and hassle-free way.

            (BBFC) are in charge of age rating films in the UK, and their
            website has plenty of information about what makes a film U-rated,
            or only suitable for over 18's (and everything in between).
          </p>
          <p>
            Rate My Film is built using data made available by the BBFC (and
            some from IMDB, too), and while it can't give you an official
            rating, it can help you get a better idea of who your film might be
            suitable for, and why.
